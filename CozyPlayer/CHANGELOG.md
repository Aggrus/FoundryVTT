# Cozy Player ChangeLog

## Version 1.2.x

### 1.2.3
* **Hotkey**: 'p' will toggle visibility of player list window (bottom left).

### 1.2.2
* **Tooltip**: Added option to show remaining spell slots.
* **Tooltip**: Tooltip color now can be defined by the player (each player can select its own color)
* **Tooltip**: Each player can choose if they see the full tooltip, simplified (no feats or items) or none. That option can be different for owned and non-owned tokens. This can help to improve the performance on low end machines. 
* **Tooltip**: Added a setting to set a delay value between hovering over a token and the tooltip appearing. Setting this value to greater then zero can improve performance by avoiding the problem of tooltip appearing on every mouse movement.
* **Chat Integration**: Added an option to separately enable/disable chat name hovering and clicking functions.
* **Send Targets to Chat**: When using 'pick random target' option, all targets are cleared, leaving only the picked one.
