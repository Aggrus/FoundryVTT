### DISCLAIER

This is just a clamped version of the original [DICE SO NICE! module](https://gitlab.com/riccisi/foundryvtt-dice-so-nice). The original module have much more fucntionality.
This version was clamped to help games where players have low tecnology affinity. And includes:

- Dices will always have the color of the player (set in system configuration) who made the roll.
- Very limited settings that players can adjust. Only some colors and textures.
- I will not update this module often as the original creator.
